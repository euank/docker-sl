# A Docker Container for Gentoo's sl

![Gentoo's SL is annoying](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2147649/18195151/de56a060-709e-11e6-8249-6d50616d18c2.png)

There are already some 'sl' commands out there, but all the ones I saw used
the debian 'sl' command, which pales compared to the one bundled with
Gentoo. The debian 'sl' simply throws a train through and calls it a day.
You see it go by and laugh. The Gentoo one, like the most annoying kid
you've ever met, just keeps going long past the point where it's no longer
funny. With no self-awareness, this 'sl' continues trucking on as you begin
considering kill -9. It gives no regard for your comfort or workflow.

This is how 'sl' should be.

I dedicate this project to Richard M. Stallman and license this repository
under the AGPL3.
